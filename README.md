# Human Resources (HR) Analysis



#### Problem:

Employee attrition can be a costly concern for companies, especially for those in sales. While some attrition is desirable (e.g., terminations), the rate of return on companies investing in employee training and incentives is greatly reduced whenever solid performers quit their jobs. The Human Resources (HR) Department is traditionally responsible for investigating employees who are at the risk of quitting in order to execute the necessary countermeasures for employee retention. Employee attrition and performance will be analyzed from an IBM data set for the Sales Department.

#### Insights:

From the IBM data set, it appears that one in five salespeople experience attrition. However, there are no significant differences in the average, minimum, or maximum monthly incomes for salespeople experiencing attrition vs. non-attrition from the calculated statistics tables. From the histogram of the monthly incomes, salespeople experiencing attrition don't seem to have as much spread in the upper brackets. It would be interesting to see scatterplots of monthly income vs. other attributes (e.g., job satisfaction, etc.), colored by attrition vs. non-attrition, for future analyses.
